``` r
library(moderndive)

data("early_january_weather")
```

The following are all the variables in the early_january_weather
dataset: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir,
wind_speed, wind_gust, percip, pressure, visib, and time_hour. Important
variables are temp, time_hour, day, hour because they explain how the
temperature changes throughout the day at each time point and hour.

The size of the dataset includes 358 rows and 15 columns.

``` r
mean (pull(early_january_weather, temp))
```

    ## [1] 39.58212

The mean temperature is 39.5821229.

``` r
ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x = time_hour, y = temp, color = humid)) + geom_point()
```

``` r

```

The pattern seen in the scatter plot is monotonic. The overall pattern
is increasing. There is also a notable change in temperature throughout
the day.

# Problem 2

``` r
data_frame = 
  tibble(
    rand_samp = rnorm (10, mean = 0),
    log_vec = rand_samp >- 0,
    char_vec = c("Hello!", "My", "name", "is", "Ashley.", "I", "am", "a", "master", "student"),
    fact_vec = factor(c("low", "low", "high", "moderate", "high", "moderate", "low", "low", "low", "moderate"))
)
```

``` r
mean (pull(data_frame, rand_samp))
```

    ## [1] 0.2534119

``` r
mean (pull(data_frame, log_vec))
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean (pull(data_frame, char_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(data_frame, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(data_frame, fact_vec))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(data_frame, fact_vec)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Only the random sample and logical vector provide a mean. The mean value
of the random sample is 0.2534119. The mean value of the logical vector
is 0.7. The character and factor vectors do not provide a mean. This is
because the character vector only contains characters and not numerical
values; similarly, the factor vector has three levels that are not
numerical. For example, the factor vector has low, moderate, high
categories; it cannot give a mean because the values within each
category are not numeric.

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(data_frame,char_vec)))

mean(as.numeric(pull(data_frame, fact_vec)))
```

The character vector does not give a mean because the characters cannot
be converted to be numerical values.However, the factor vector has three
levels that can be converted to numerical values. Therefore, the factor
vector provides a mean. The mean value of the factor vector is 2.1.
