# Problem 1
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
data("early_january_weather")
```

The following are all the variables in the early_january_weather dataset: origin, year, month, day, hour, temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, percip, pressure, visib, and time_hour. Important variables are temp, time_hour, day, hour because they explain how the temperature changes throughout the day at each time point and hour.

The size of the dataset includes `r nrow(early_january_weather) ` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns.
